## Who I am

I’m Natalie Gallo (@natalie-gallo)! Nice to meet you <3

Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

Proud Latina ☺️

Love all things Beyonce, anime, musicals, and webtoons!

## What I do

I’m a college student majoring in Computer Science and work as a part-time Undergraduate Teaching Assistant. Currently learning iOS Development and grinding school work :,)

## When I began programming

Started with JavaScript in my high school's computer science elective when I was 16/17. Didn't really solidify my pursuits until the following year
when I enrolled in a college level Intro to Computer Science class that I now TA for!

## Where I am based

New York City!

## Why I chose to pursue a career in tech

I never really had a particular interest that I thought I could make a career out of. Then, when I took my first coding class, it peaked my interest. 
It was the first unconventional class I had ever taken (as in outside the typical general Math, English, History, and Science classes I've taken). I 
told myself I'll try this out and see where it takes me. Have had my ups and downs but I'm sticking it out. Come join the ride!
